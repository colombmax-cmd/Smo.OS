# PLOS — Personal Life Operating System
## Vision Specification v0.1

---

## 1. Core Definition

The Personal Life Operating System (PLOS) is a protocol framework designed to structure, store and synchronize abstract personal cognitive states independently from the tools that interpret them.

PLOS operates at the level of **formal cognitive representation**, not interpretation.

It defines structure — not meaning.

---

## 2. Scope of the PLOS

### Included in Scope

#### Structured Cognitive Representation

PLOS defines primitives allowing representation of:

- goals
- tasks
- events
- metrics
- contexts
- relationships between these elements

without imposing semantic meaning.

PLOS is a grammar, not a narrative.

---

#### Synchronization and Portability

PLOS enables:

- data exchange between systems
- multi-device synchronization
- universal import/export
- historical persistence

---

#### Access Control and Security

PLOS includes:

- permission models
- encryption mechanisms
- local identity management

to protect personal cognitive states.

---

#### Ontological Extensibility

Domain-specific vocabularies may be added:

- finance
- education
- health
- organization
- personal projects

without modifying the core protocol.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope

This section is critical.

PLOS intentionally excludes:

### Intelligent Interpretation

PLOS does not:

- reason
- advise
- decide
- optimize behavior

LLMs and intelligent agents exist **above** PLOS, never inside it.

---

### User Interfaces

PLOS defines no:

- UX
- visualization
- interaction model

Interfaces are implementations.

---

### Psychological or Lifestyle Models

PLOS assumes no model of:

- productivity
- motivation
- wellbeing
- personal value

It prescribes nothing.

---

### Mandatory Cloud Infrastructure

PLOS must not depend on:

- a provider
- a central server
- a single platform

---

### Civil or Social Identity

PLOS is not:

- a national identity system
- a social network
- a digital passport

---

## Operational Analogy

PLOS is to cognition what a filesystem is to data.

It organizes.
It does not understand content.

---

## Critical Boundary

PLOS stops at the structural representation of cognitive states.

Interpretation, optimization or evaluation are explicitly outside the protocol.

---

## Ultra-Condensed Definition

PLOS defines the **structure and transport of personal cognitive states**, not their meaning or usage.

---

## 3. Foundational Analogies

### Primary Analogy

PLOS ≈ TCP/IP for cognition.

Like TCP/IP, PLOS:

- defines a minimal shared layer
- enables interoperability
- separates protocol from content
- allows ecosystems to emerge above it

---

### Structural Analogy

PLOS ≈ a filesystem for cognition.

It organizes hierarchy, persistence and relationships without interpreting content.

---

### Ecosystem Analogy

PLOS ≈ Linux / POSIX for cognitive tools.

It provides a stable interface allowing assistants, modules and agents to coexist.

---

### Philosophical Analogy

PLOS ≈ structured writing for thought.

Writing externalized memory.
PLOS externalizes structured cognitive organization.

---

### Analogy to Avoid

PLOS is NOT a personal assistant.

Assistants interpret and act.
PLOS structures and transports.

Confusing both leads to centralization.

---

## 4. Problems Addressed by PLOS

PLOS does not solve productivity micro-issues.

It addresses structural problems of digital cognition.

### Cognitive Fragmentation

Modern users distribute cognition across incompatible tools.

PLOS introduces a shared structural layer enabling interoperability.

---

### Data Captivity

Platform lock-in breaks cognitive continuity.

PLOS guarantees portability and tool interchangeability.

---

### Absence of a Standard for AI-Assisted Cognition

Current assistants operate in silos.

PLOS enables portable memory and interchangeable agents.

---

### Centralization of Cognitive Power

Platforms increasingly become mandatory intermediaries.

PLOS promotes decentralization and implementation plurality.

---

### Mechanical Cognitive Load

Humans spend effort maintaining structure rather than thinking.

PLOS externalizes mechanical organization.

---

### Ecosystem Incompatibility

Digital tools remain isolated gardens.

PLOS enables modular innovation through shared standards.

---

## 5. Non-Negotiable Principles (Axioms)

### 1 — User Sovereignty
Users retain full control over their cognitive data.

Including ownership, exportability, local storage and encryption.

No implementation may create captivity.

---

### 2 — Core Neutrality
The PLOS core encodes no model of success, value or behavior.

It transports structures, not judgments.

---

### 3 — Universal Portability
All PLOS data must remain exportable and interpretable across independent implementations.

---

### 4 — Open Standard Interoperability
Interfaces are public and permissionless.

The standard belongs to the community.

---

### 5 — Capture Resistance
Architecture must prevent durable concentration of power through:

- forkability
- multiple implementations
- absence of central control

---

### 6 — Core Minimalism
The core defines only what is strictly necessary.

Interpretation belongs to upper layers.

---

### 7 — Privacy by Design
Privacy protection is architectural, not optional.

Data minimization and explicit consent are mandatory principles.

---

## 6. Explicit Limits

PLOS must never become:

- a cognitive authority
- a behavioral control system
- a centralized infrastructure
- a surveillance mechanism
- a social scoring system

The system structures — it never governs.

---

## 7. Ethical Boundaries

PLOS acknowledges that cognitive infrastructure can influence autonomy.

Therefore:

- human decision autonomy must remain primary
- behavioral manipulation is forbidden
- cultural neutrality must be preserved
- deep integration must remain reversible

PLOS may augment cognition — never colonize it.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

A successful PLOS is:

- interoperable
- portable
- non-capturable
- pluralistic
- minimal
- widely implementable
- cognitively beneficial

---

## 9. Strategic Pilot Domains

Initial validation domains:

- personal administration
- personal finance
- personal projects
- learning and education
- lightweight personal health tracking

High-risk domains (social identity, social networks, enterprise control) are intentionally excluded from early adoption.

---

## Final Principle

PLOS maximizes individual autonomy while minimizing structural concentration of power.
