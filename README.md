# Smo.OS POC
**Smooth Personal Life Operating System**

A minimal, open, and sovereign protocol to manage your personal cognitive states without friction.

## Quick Vision
Smo.OS is the invisible layer that makes your cognition flow smoothly:  
- Zero seams between your tools  
- Zero structural loss  
- Zero dependency on a cloud or central actor  

It’s your second brain, in smooth mode.

## Current Status
POC V0.1 in progress:  
- Core primitives (Entity, Relation, Event, Context)  
- Append-only event-log  
- Canonical export  
- Basic local sync  

## Next Steps
1. Implement the CLI core  
2. Interop demo (two local instances)  
3. 2–3 min demo video  

## Contact / Discussions
Open to ideas, feedback, code!  
→ Issues or PRs welcome.

Smo.OS: cognition without friction.
